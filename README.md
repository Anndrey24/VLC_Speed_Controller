# VLC Speed Controller
Speed Controller Extension for VLC Media Player 3.0  
This extension allows you to quickly switch between 1.0x speed and a user configurable target speed, while also providing a GUI for playback control.  
Inspired by the functionality of the Google Chrome extension [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed), as well as VLC extensions [Playback Speed Manager](https://github.com/ilgaiaz/playback-speed-manager) and [Jump to time Previous frame v3](https://addons.videolan.org/p/1154013/).  

## Features
- type in playback speed
- decrease playback speed
- increase playback speed
- toggle between 1.0x speed and previous playback speed
- set playback speed to user configurable preferred speed
- rewind / advance video by a set number of seconds
- jump to the next frame
